Module 19 Challenge

Neural Networks and Depp Learning - Part 2
## Project: Module 19 submission
## Description:
Develop a multiclass neural network for HR to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so the model should predict the department that best fits each employee. Base the prediction on a branched neural network. 

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn 
- tensorflow.keras

## Input dataset:
Input file containing employee information

## Goal:
Predict if employee is likely to leave the company and which department may be a good fit, based on a branched neural net

## Jupyter Notebook:
attrition.ipynb

## Output:
Develop the model and predict the accuracy of department and attrition
Discuss the best metrics for the model, selection of activation functions and how the model could be improved.
